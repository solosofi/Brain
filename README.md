# Project GODBRAIN

An advanced modular AI architecture with symbolic reasoning and meta-awareness capabilities.

## Overview

Project GODBRAIN aims to take conversational AI to the next level by creating an advanced modular architecture that reasons logically and possesses meta-awareness. This AI will self-correct, simulate hypothetical outcomes, and critically evaluate its own decisions.

For detailed information about the project, see [PROJECT.md](./project.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and development
- `src/`: Source code for the GODBRAIN components
  - `perception/`: Perception Layer implementation
  - `logical_core/`: Symbolic reasoning engine
  - `world_model/`: World modeling components
  - `hypothesis/`: Hypothesis generation module
  - `reality_checker/`: Reality checking module
  - `metacognition/`: Meta-cognition unit
- `data/`: Knowledge bases and training data
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Development

This project uses Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and development. Each component will be tested and iteratively developed in notebooks before being integrated into the main codebase.
