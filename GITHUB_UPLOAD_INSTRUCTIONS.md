# GitHub Upload Instructions

Your GODBRAIN project has been prepared for GitHub with the following steps already completed:

- Git repository initialized
- Git user configured
- .gitignore file created for Python projects
- All files added and committed

## Complete the GitHub Upload

To finish uploading your project to GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

- Go to https://github.com/new
- Enter a repository name (e.g., 'godbrain')
- Add an optional description
- Choose public or private visibility
- Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
- Click 'Create repository'

### 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

Run these commands in your project directory, replacing 'YOUR-USERNAME' with your actual GitHub username:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/godbrain.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify the upload

Visit your GitHub repository URL to confirm all files were uploaded successfully.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push to a repository with:

```
git branch -M main
gh repo create godbrain --private --source=. --push
```

This will create a private repository named 'godbrain' and push your code to it.
